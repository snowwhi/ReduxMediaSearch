Making Slices
Slice1 Search
   first remember one thing that create slice comes from @redux/toolkit
   for making a slice name it anything 
   it has three things 
   first name
   second initial value
   imp trick just like useState first read and 2nd is write only value same concept can be used 
   initial state all read values
   3rd is reducers 
   reducers are actually the main functionality 
   naming it with write value convention like setThis and setThat
   and in that function 
   u r provided with two thing actions and state 
   state what is this like what to display
   action is like what to do exactly
  export all functions from anything.actions 
  export whole slice 
  this whole thing is going to be passed to store 
  same goes to our store no Two Collection
